## Description

A minimalistic web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui), and TypeScript. Save and follow your favorite crypto currency's activity in the market like you are looking up the weather. This was built to present a simpler, more de-cluttered interface than most crypto currency apps. Designed for beginners in the crypto currency space and for people that want to quickly get a glance at the market.

_\*You cannot buy or trade cryptos with this application. Prices are in USD. Listed cryptos are from [Coinbase's](https://www.coinbase.com/) current listings._
